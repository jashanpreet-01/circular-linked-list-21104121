Question 1: While traversing a single-circular linked list, which condition establishes that the traversing  
element /variable has reached the first element?

Answer:

 A pointer to the list's first node is found at the list's last node in a circular singly linked list. When we reach the first node once more in a 
 circular linked list, the traversal is stopped. The last item's next pointer in a singly linked list points to the first item. A singly linked list
 only has one pointer that leads to NULL, which is the pointer from the list's final node. The 'Next' pointer of the last node must point to the first 
 node if we want the singly linked list to be circular. The last node of the list must be present for the traversing element to have reached the first 
 element.
